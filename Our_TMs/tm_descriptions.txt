Descriptions

tm1.txt recognizes the language described by L = { w={0,1}* | where |w| = 2n }
The language is an even number of zeroes and ones greater than 0.




tm2.txt alters the input string such that the characters a, b, and c never occur out of order.
That is to say that an a can be followed by another a or a b, but not a c,  b can be followed by
itself or c, and c can be followed by itself or a. It does this by inserting the missing character.

aa: is fine
ab: is fine
ac: insert b
bb: fine
bc: fine
ba: insert c
cc: fine
cb: insert a
ca: fine



tm3.txt adds two binary numbers of length 4.  Given the string 0010+0001=00000 it will return
0010+0001=00011.  The first two numbers are the ones to be added, equalling the third.
